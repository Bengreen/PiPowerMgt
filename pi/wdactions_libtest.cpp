A brief demonstration of the Raspberry Pi I2C interface, using the SparkFun
Pi Wedge breakout board.

Resources:

This example makes use of the Wiring Pi library, which streamlines the interface
the the I/O pins on the Raspberry Pi, providing an API that is similar to the
Arduino.  You can learn about installing Wiring Pi here:
http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/

The I2C API is documented here:
https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/i2c-library/

The init call returns a standard file descriptor.  More detailed configuration
of the interface can be performed using ioctl calls on that descriptor.
See the wiringPi I2C implementation (wiringPi/wiringPiI2C.c) for some examples.
Parameters configurable with ioctl are documented here:
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/i2c/dev-interface

Hardware connections:

This file interfaces with the SparkFun MCP4725 breakout board:
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8736

The board was connected as follows:
(Raspberry Pi)(MCP4725)
GND  -> GND
3.3V -> Vcc
SCL  -> SCL
SDA  -> SDA

An oscilloscope probe was connected to the analog output pin of the MCP4725.

To build this file, I use the command:
>  g++ i2ctest.cpp -lwiringPi

Then to run it, first the I2C kernel module needs to be loaded.  This can be
done using the GPIO utility.
> gpio load i2c 400
> ./a.out

This will run the MCP through its output range several times.  A rising
sawtooth will be seen on the analog output.

Development environment specifics:
Tested on Raspberry Pi V2 hardware, running Raspbian.
Building with GCC 4.6.3 (Debian 4.6.3-14+rpi1)

This code is beerware; if you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at the
local, and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!
